    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Strawberry pretzel salad is an easy dessert with lots of contrasting textures and flavors. It isn't too sweet, nor too salty, and looks really pretty when you make it in a glass ovenproof baking dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pretzels: To easily make crushed pretzels, place them in a zip-top bag and crush them with a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Butter: Melted butter lends moisture and helps bind the crushed pretzels together, creating a delicious crust.</li>
        <li>Sugar: You'll need white sugar for the pretzel crust and for the fluffy cream cheese topping.</li>
        <li>Cream cheese and whipped topping: Beat cream cheese, sugar, and whipped topping together to make a decadent topping.</li>
        <li>Jell-O and frozen strawberries: Dissolve two packages of strawberry-flavored Jell-O in two cups of boiling water, then combine with frozen strawberries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the pretzel crust, press into the bottom of a baking dish, and bake.</li>
        <li>Make the cream cheese-whipped topping layer, then spread over the crust.</li>
        <li>Make the Jell-O, then stir in the frozen berries. Spread over the cream cheese layer.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the strawberry pretzel salad until set.</li>
    </ol>
